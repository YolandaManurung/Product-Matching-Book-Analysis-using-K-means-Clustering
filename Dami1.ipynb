      " FULL REVIEW POSTED If you re reading this  please be warned that you re in for one hell of a rant  There will be quite a lot of swearing and some minor spoilers   Major spoilers will be marked   Also  if you liked this book and have a problem with me trashing everything you ve ever loved  you may want to turn back now    I m giving you one more chance  This is actually the worst book rant I ve ever written    No  You really want to read this review  Move right the fuck along  then  Don t say I didn t warn you  You know when you re at the beach on a really nice summer day  and the sand is all nice and soft and the sun is warm but not too hot and you walk down to the edge of the water for what you just know is going to be a gloriously refreshing swim in the ocean       so you start wading in  and it seems fine at first  and then all of a sudden your foot comes down in the middle of a massive swath of slimy  smelly  warm seaweed aND YOU TRY TO STEP BACK OUT BUT SUDDENLY IT S EVERYWHERE AND IT S AWFUL AND YOUR DAY GOES TO SHIT  THAT is what reading this book felt like  Buuuut before I get started with the rant  let s just get this out of the way and discuss the only thing I actually liked  Lucien  I remember thinking Lucien was just okay in ACOTAR and ACOMAF  Everyone seems to love him  but I was always kind of indifferent towards him  Surprisingly  he was the only character who had actual development in this book  and I ended up liking him way more than I expected to  Getting to see the Autumn Court and learning more about his family and history made him finally feel like a fully fleshed out character  rather than just Tamlin s mediocre sidekick  I still don t really give a shit about him and Elain  but his friendship with Feyre was lovely  I feel like male female friendships that are truly platonic are so hard to come by in YA books  and it was so great to see the two of them overcome the anger and guilt that had grown between them in previous books  Unfortunately  Lucien ends up going off on some random ass irrelevant mission for half the book  leaving me stuck with one of the dullest groups of characters I ve read about in a while   sigh  Now that that s over  the rest of this review is basically gonna be a list of all the stuff I hated  which was  everything else  tbh  This is super unorganized and in no particular order  The Spring Court  Alright  the Spring Court was boring and annoying in books 1 and 2  so I wasn t really looking forward to being back there  I thought things would have least been a little more interesting with Feyre 2 0 back to fuck shit up  but all I got was some half assed Cersei wannabe who was so hell bent on her personal revenge plot that she gave zero fucks about the consequences and hypocrisy of her actions  The one dimensional villain  This was one of my biggest issues with this book  There is absolutely NO moral gray area  every aspect of the war is as black and white as a fucking dalmatian  Why exactly does Hybern want to invade Prythian and take down the wall separating the human realm         Literally all we are told  over and over again  is that Hybern is ruthless and vicious and evil and BLAH BLAH BLAH I DON T CARE  I can accept Amarantha being a sadistic psychopath with little complexity  but even she had her reasons for what she did  In this book ALL of the people from Hybern are universally evil demonic asshats  and as I refuse to believe that an entire nation is composed only of murderous psychopaths  I call bullshit  There s a bunch of infodump about how the king has somehow brainwashed his whole population into supporting the war     but I don t fucking buy it  If the people of Hybern were the least impacted by the treaty that split the other territories  as we are explicitly told   why would they be the most opposed to it  I personally LOVE politics  and the political aspect of worldbuilding is always one of my favorite parts of reading high fantasy  ummmm news flash  countries don t decide to go to war with each other just for the heck of it       People and nations are complex  and politics and alliances and wars are hella complicated  Reading about the melodramatic nonsensical shit that passed for politics in this book felt like I was being talked down to  and it pissed me off majorly  The fucking Wall  There s also a shit ton of infodump about the history of the wall  and I felt like I kept falling into a boring and oversimplified history lecture  It was all giving me some serious ASOIAF vibes  too  You could basically just replace the Cauldron with the horn of Joramun and the faeries with the wildlings and some of the plot points genuinely sound as if they were ripped straight from the plot of A Storm of Swords  except way lamer and not nearly as well developed  I m honestly annoyed at myself for even discussing these books in the same sentence   Jurian  Why is Jurian even in this book      Like  I get that he was important in the last war  but he and his and his whole plotline seem so irrelevant to everything else that s going on  He s just so fucking extra and unnecessary  his existence annoys me  I won t even waste any more time writing about him  The writing  It s so  Fucking  Repetitive  The exact same descriptions are used over and over again for every character  every conversation  every situation  If I never have to read about mates and males and velvet everything and purring and vulgar gestures I will die a happy woman  And  on the subject of said repetitive writing     The sex scenes  It felt like the first half of the book was 90  Feysand either having sex  sending each other mental nudes  or talking in their heads about how they wanted to  feast on  and  devour  each other  the writing was BEYOND cringe y  and then they had the nerve to be surprised when they were too late to stop Hybern from breaking down the wall         They were also all written the same way  once you d read one  there was nothing new or interesting about them  The library  I m really fucking pissed about this  The library is a place that we learn has been transformed into a sanctuary for women who have been sexually abused and assaulted  They re able to have a place of peace and quiet where they can stay as long as they want while they heal  I don t know why I thought this book might actually provide a fair representation of recovery from trauma   but any good the inclusion of this library and these women might have done was utterly ruined by the way it was disrespected and used as a plot device  First  the library seemed to be introduced for the sole purpose of making Rhys look better the focus was on what a saintly person he was for helping these women rather than actually giving them any page time themselves  Then  when Rhys and Feyre are supposed to be doing actual research in the library  they re so fucking horny they apparently think it s completely fine to almost have sex in a library that once again  is RUN by women who have been sexually abused  How the actual fuck is that supposed to be okay         If that wasn t enough  the librarians are then treated as even more of a plot device when an attack from Hybern occurs there to make it seem even more outrageous and violating  In response  Feyre and Rhys are all like  oh that sucks that they won t feel safe here anymore    and what do they fucking do about it     NOTHING  They don t actually give a shit about these women so they move on with life and never give them a second thought  UGH  Feyre being a hypocrite  I love how Feyre got all indignant in the last book about High Fae treating other faeries like shit and yet she still calls them  lesser faeries    also  while she was in the Spring Court I get she was mad but she just never seemed to give a shit about the harm her actions could cause ordinary people     Just because she s physically stronger and more powerful doesn t mean she has to lose the ability to empathize with and care about other people  The sexism  Okay  it s like this book couldn t decide whether it wanted to be set in a world with a patriarchy or not  Why has there never been a High Lady     Only allowing High Lords seems really blatantly sexist  but there doesn t seem to be much overt sexism in Prythian  I mean  it s definitely there  but it doesn t seem quite strong enough for all women to be entirely denied the right to govern  It just doesn t make sense why none of the female High Fae have never even tried to challenge this law tradition precedent        there are so many infuriating plot holes in the worldbuilding UGGHHHHH  The slut shaming  It was OUT OF CONTROL in this book  I can t even give a rough estimate for the number of times Feyre  Mor  and Rhys were insulted  degraded  and verbally abused because of who they d had sex with   and seeing how Mor and Rhys were assaulted and abused  it was especially awful  I mean  the people saying these things were clearly the ones we reader are meant to view as  evil   but the sheer number of these insults seemed ridiculously unnecessary  It was annoying and tedious to have to read through so many of them  and they felt like a cheap plot device to further emphasize the black and white divide between the  good  and  bad  characters  Speaking of which   The characters  I don t even know how to fully express my disappointment with how this book treated my favs  It s like all of the characters I loved in ACOMAF turned out to be a lineup of those inflatable Christmas decorations  and someone went around and poked holes in them and now they re just sad and flat and boring  It breaks my heart because I had so much love for Feyre and Rhys and all the rest of the Inner Circle in ACOMAF and somehow I didn t give the slightest shit about any of them in this book      I don t even want to go into it  I m so bitter  I still love Nesta  but even she was a bit disappointing  She was my favorite character because of her subtle but fierce characterization in the last two books  and she had more development than most of the others in this  but she still spent most of her time sitting around doing nothing  The immaturity of said characters  The comments they make  the way they stick their tongues out at people     if I didn t know I was reading a book about centuries old faeries and there weren t a shit ton of unnecessary sex scenes  I d think I was reading a middle grade novel  Magic that s poorly explained doesn t make sense  What even is a shadowsinger     I still don t know        What exactly Azriel is was never defined and I have no idea why it s significant what his powers are  this pisses me off  What happened to the tracking thing Hybern had on Rhys s power in ACOMAF    It was mentioned towards the end but didn t seem to be nearly as important in this book  whereas in the last one it was a major cause of him barely using his powers  Also  so are we all just okay with the fact that after Feyre was transformed into a Mary Sue High Fae she basically got every fucking power that ever existed   And she doesn t need to actually train to master said powers  she can just use them whenever the fuck she wants   Ugghhhh it feels so incredibly unnecessary and over the top     THE REST OF THIS REVIEW WILL BE SPOILER Y  READ AT YOUR OWN RISK          The ships  I completely lost interest in Feysand  Nessian was mildly interesting but mostly pushed to the side  I don t give a shit about the Azriel Elain Lucien love triangle that appears to be forming  and Amren and Varian     That was really fucking random     I just want to scream  NOT EVERYONE NEEDS A SHIP  from the top of a mountain because I m honestly so annoyed about this  The attempts at LGBTQ representation  Mor s sexuality             Where the fuck did that come from       I m just genuinely confused bc in ACOMAF it seemed to be quite obvious that she did have feelings for Azriel  None of this makes sense  She started off saying she preferred women and that was why she could never love Azriel  but then she was like  oh well I actually enjoy sleeping with both genders      ummm what kinda logic is that supposed to be   Either way  it was a shitty thing to do to lead her friend on for centuries and now I m pissed at her  She didn t even have to come out  she just had to straight up tell him she wasn t in love with him  I can understand her not wanting to come out to her family  but it just doesn t make sense why she would hide it from the whole inner circle the people she loves and trusts more than anyone else  The more I think about this reveal the less it makes sense  There were no hints  it serves no purpose in the plot  and it feels like a cheap attempt to make the series count as diverse  The minor characters also felt like such a half assed attempt at diversity  It was felt so strange bc there was literally no mention of anyone who wasn t totally heterosexual in the first two books  and it felt like ACOWAR was trying way too hard to be like  look     gay people      threesomes      It s like    it s nice that the author tried  but poor representation and having all the LGBTQ characters be either inconsequentially minor or badly developed doesn t make your book really qualify as embracing diversity  Tamlin  He was still awful     I don t care if he was supposedly working against Hybern in secret the whole time  if that was true he should have fucking told Feyre like he promised he would  He s not just a shitty person  he s a shitty character  He s lost all semblance of personality and essentially exists only to highlight what a great guy Rhys supposedly is  I gather that his storyline was supposed to be some kind of redemption arc  but like       You can t just have a character suddenly act nice at the end of the book when there was no actual development shown to precede that      The ending  This was some next level deus ex machina shit  I hated it  Of course these randos and minor characters showed up to win the battle for them  Why did I expect that Feyre and Rhys and all the rest of those useless idiots would actually manage to save themselves  The scene with the ouroboros was BEYOND anticlimactic  This was supposed to be something that had turned people made for centuries and perfect Feyre had no problem looking into it    I call bullshit  Vassa  Bryaxis  the Bone Carver  Stryga  Miryam and Dragon or whatever the fuck his name is  all of these characters creatures had potential to be interesting  but they were so inconsequential and received so little attention that the book would have been better off without them  And then what happened with Amren    I actually really liked her in that moment  and I feel like for the first time in this series we finally caught a glimpse of her real character  I just wish there had been more of that throughout the book  less of everyone talking about how terrifying Amren is and more about her actually being badass  Rhys s death  I was just so completely beyond the point of caring by then  and it all felt awfully cliche and been there  done that  It s like this book actually drained all of the emotions out of me  I hated it that much  Well  I think that s enough trashing for today  You can find my wonderful BR partner Camille s review here  and also please read Em s review because it s fucking fantastic  I mostly likely will not be picking up another SJM book in the future  I just don t think her writing is for me and ACOMAF must have been some kind of random fluke  Also  I don t think my friendship with Solomon would survive another review this harsh  Anyway  thanks for reading  I hope you all enjoy the next books you read more than I enjoyed this                                            Continuing my buddy read of this series with the lovely Camille  I am both excited and terrified by the insanely mixed reviews I ve seen for this  Let s be honest I m mostly just here for my wife Nesta  less \n",
